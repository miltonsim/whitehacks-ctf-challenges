## The Forgotten Keys

### Description
You've found a set of keys under the carpet of your friend's house on Christmas day. A note accompanied the keys, reading: "Seek, and you shall find. The access key is incomplete. Only I remember the last three characters."" It seems that only the access key is incomplete, while the secret key is complete. Can you figure out what these keys unlock, and what you can do with them?"

Note: Only the access key is incomplete. The secret key is complete.

Access Key: `Incomplete AWS access key` \
Secret Key: `Complete AWS access secret key`

### Solution 
1. Bruteforce keys using Python script
2. Utilise enumerate-iam tools to identify valid IAM credentials.
